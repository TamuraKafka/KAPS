## Description of folder name
We apply the Shapiro‚ÄìWilk Test method to analyze the normality in the frequency statistical test of the datasets.
Since the original dataset consists of a large proportion of workers who have only annotated a few tasks, 
it does not meet the detection conditions of the Shapiro-Wilk test algorithm.
Hence,workers with fewer than 5 total label tasks are removed from the dataset GoodReads_309t_120415w. 
Therefore, we obtain a new dataset, where the number of label tasks for each worker is greater than 5, satisfying the detection requirements. 
This dataset is GoodReads_5702_309t_0%.

Next, we process the resulting dataset GoodReads_5702_309t_0% and get ten datasets.
the Shapiro-Wilk test is conducted for all label results of each worker,and the corresponding ùë§ value for each worker is calculated.
The ùë§ values are sorted in ascending order, and datasets are generated by continuously excluding workers with small ùë§ values, 
at a 5% scale, leading to ten datasets. 
For example, GoodReads_5415_309t_5% dataset means sort in ascending order of w values, excluding those achieved by the top 5% of the smallest workers.          Similarly, Douban_6543w_10% represents the values sorted in ascending order of w, excluding the top 10% of workers.
Through this rule, we extract and sort out ten datasets from the original dataset GoodReads_5702_309t_0%, which have not been modified except the data size.

## Folder data source
The dataset GoodReads_5702_309t_0% is extracted and collated from the dataset GoodReads_309t_120415w.
The ten data sets of GoodReads_5415_309t_5% ~ GoodReads_2850_308t_50% are obtained from the GoodReads_5702_309t_0% dataset by continuously excluding the people with the lowest w value in proportion.
